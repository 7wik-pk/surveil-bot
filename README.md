Instructions:

- Navigate to the `project/project.ino` script and modify the code within the `loop` block accordingly to set the hardcoded path. Predefined movement functions can be utilized/modified accordingly.
- Load the script onto an Arduino Uno.
- Assemble a robot car chassis appropriate for Arduino projects. For the purposes of this demo, I use the following chassis:
